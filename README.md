Module 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

In this challenge, I completed the code for a Work Day Scheduler.

<ul>When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.</ul>
<ul>When the user scrolls down, then they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.</ul>
<ul>When the user views the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.</ul>
<ul>When a time block is clicked into, then an event can be entered.</ul>
<ul>When the save button is clicked, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.</ul>
<ul>When the page is refreshed, then the saved events persist.</ul>
